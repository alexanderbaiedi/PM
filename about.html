# About Me

I’m a product-minded systems builder focused on automation, operations, and workflow design.

Most of my work centers on turning manual, error-prone processes into reliable systems that are fast, clear, and hard to break.

I’ve designed and built tools that:
- Reduce response time in high-stakes workflows
- Prevent missed assignments and dropped handoffs
- Centralize fragmented data into usable systems
- Balance speed with reliability and trust

### Technical Toolkit
- Python, Django
- Google APIs (Gmail, Sheets, Calendar)
- Automation & data pipelines
- Lightweight frontends and dashboards

This portfolio highlights real systems I’ve built and the thinking behind them.
