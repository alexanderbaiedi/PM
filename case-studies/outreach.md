# Interpreter Outreach Automation

**Reduced interpreter response time from 30–60 minutes to under 5 minutes**

---

## The Problem

Interpreter assignments were frequently at risk due to slow, manual outreach processes.

- Outreach relied on manual emails and spreadsheets
- Interpreters responded too late or not at all
- No reliable way to track outreach, responses, or commitments
- Missed or delayed responses could result in lost jobs

---

## Constraints

This was a high-stakes, real-world coordination problem with several constraints:

- Interpreters distributed across hundreds of cities
- Data fragmented across CSVs and Google Sheets
- Outreach volume risked triggering spam filters
- Speed mattered, but reliability mattered more

---

## The Solution

I designed and built an automated outreach system that:

- Filters interpreters by city and distance
- Sends high-deliverability outreach emails at scale
- Tracks outreach activity, responses, and suppressions
- Supports follow-ups without re-contacting uninterested interpreters

The system prioritized **clarity, trust, and deliverability** rather than brute-force messaging.

---

## Results

- **100+ interpreters contacted per minute**
- **Commitments received within 3–5 minutes**
- **No lost assignments during test periods**
- Significant improvement in inbox placement and response rates

---

## Process & Tradeoffs

Early versions focused on speed, but testing showed that deliverability and message trust had a larger impact on outcomes.

I iterated toward:
- Fewer but higher-quality messages
- Better timing and sender reputation
- Clear, low-friction calls to action

## Reflection

The biggest insight was that fast systems fail if people don’t trust them.  
Designing for reliability and human response patterns unlocked better results than raw automation alone.
